# CuLSM-CPU

:warning::warning::warning: **This is the cpu version of [CuLSM](https://github.com/Chiang-Yuan/culsm) without CUDA supported parallism** :warning::warning::warning:

For GPU-accelerated lattice spring model simulation, please refer to the original repository [CuLSM](https://github.com/Chiang-Yuan/culsm).

**Cuda-accelerated lattice spring model (CuLSM)** is the CUDA C++ code implementing GPU parallelization on particle and spring lists. The code is associated with the paper "[ImageMech: From Image to Particle Spring Network for Mechanical Characterization](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmats.2021.803875/full)" published in [Frontiers in Materials](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/materials). 

If you happen to use this code in your work, please cite:

Instead of spatial decomposition as used in [LAMMPS](https://www.lammps.org/), CuLSM applies parallization to atom and bond lists and therefore secures remarkable speedup for large-scale lattice spring model simulations.

## Prerequisites

- GPU compute capabtility > 6.x for 64-bit floating point operation
- CUDA Toolkit >= 10.1 recommended

## Build

To buld `culsm` on your device, GPU architecture must be specified at the time of compilation. In `Makefile`, make sure the `NVFLAGS` fit your device. 

```shell
NVFLAGS = 	-O3 -I$(CUDIR)/include -m64 -arch=compute_75 -code=sm_75 -Xptxas -v -rdc=true
```

The GPU architecture (*e.g.* Kepler, Turing, *etc*.) may be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA#GPUs_supported), and the cooresponding CUDA naming scheme can be found in [Nvidia GPU Feature List](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-compiler-driver-nvcc/index.html#gpu-feature-list).

To compile the code, simply execute make in the terminal.

```shell
make
```

## Usage

```shell
./culsm-cpu < [input] > [output] &
```

## Example Command Script

```
read_data       <file>
